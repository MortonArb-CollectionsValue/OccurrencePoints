 1_get_taxonomic_info.R
################################################################################

 OVERVIEW: Takes a list of taxa and uses the taxize package to pull taxonomic
           information from multiple databases. The output can then be used to
           create a final list of target taxa and synonyms by hand.

           Data pulled includes:

             - Acceptance and authors from Tropicos, Integrated Taxonomic
                Information Service (ITIS), and The Plant List (TPL)
             - Authors from International Plant Names Index (IPNI) and
                Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS)
             - Synonyms from Tropicos and ITIS

 INPUTS: List of target taxa

 OUTPUTS: List of target taxa with acceptance, authors, and synonyms

 2_get_raw_occurrence_points.R
################################################################################

 OVERVIEW: Provides manual instructions and code chunks for downloading and
           standardizing wild occurrence points from:

           * Global databases (though all likely have U.S. bias?):

             - Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)
             - Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio)
             - U.S. Herbarium Consortia (SERNEC, SEINet, etc.)
             - Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN)

           * National databases:

             - Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program, USDA Forest Service

 INPUTS: List of target taxa, including:
          - synonyms & their accepted names (target_taxa_with_syn.csv),
          - FIA codes & sp. names (FIA_AppendixF_TreeSpeciesCodes_2016.csv),
          - county and state codes (US_state_county_FIPS_codes.csv),
          - FIA plot data (PLOT.csv)

 OUTPUTS: Raw occurrence records for target taxa or genera (depending on how
          the databaseâ€™s download works); one CSV for each database

################################################################################
 3_compile_raw_occurrence_points.R
################################################################################

 OVERVIEW: Compiles raw occurrence point data downloaded in
           2_get_raw_occurrence_points.R:

             - stack all data
             - filter by target taxa
             - standardize key columns (localityDescription, year,
               basisOfRecord, establishmentMeans)
             - check validity of lat and long (can be plotted); if invalid,
               switch and check again; set to NA if still invalid
             - create subsets for localityDescription only and lat-long points
             - remove duplicates by species_name_acc, lat_round, long_round,
               and establishmentMeans
             - mark rows with lat-long matching U.S. county centroids to 2
               places after the decimal
             - split into separate CSVs by species_name_acc

 INPUTS: raw datasets from 2_get_raw_occurrence_points.R; list of target taxa

 OUTPUTS: "occurrence_point_count_per_species.csv"; CSV of points for each species
