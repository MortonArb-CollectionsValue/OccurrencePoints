 1_get_taxonomic_info.R
################################################################################

 OVERVIEW: Takes a list of taxa and uses the taxize package to pull taxonomic
           information from multiple databases. The output can then be used to
           create a final list of target taxa and synonyms by hand.

           Data pulled includes:

             - Acceptance and authors from Tropicos, Integrated Taxonomic
                Information Service (ITIS), and The Plant List (TPL)
             - Authors from International Plant Names Index (IPNI) and
                Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS)
             - Synonyms from Tropicos and ITIS

 INPUTS: List of target taxa

 OUTPUTS: List of target taxa with acceptance, authors, and synonyms

 2_get_raw_occurrence_points.R
################################################################################

 OVERVIEW: Provides manual instructions and code chunks for downloading and
           standardizing wild occurrence points from:

           * Global databases (though all likely have U.S. bias?):

             - Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)
             - Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio)
             - U.S. Herbarium Consortia (SERNEC, SEINet, etc.)
             - Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN)

           * National databases:

             - Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program, USDA Forest Service

 INPUTS: List of target taxa, including synonyms and their accepted names
             (target_taxa_with_syn.csv), FIA codes and species names (FIA_AppendixF_TreeSpeciesCodes_2016.csv), county and state codes (US_state_county_FIPS_codes.csv)

 OUTPUTS: Raw occurrence records for target taxa or genera (depending on how
          the databaseâ€™s download works), one CSV for each database
