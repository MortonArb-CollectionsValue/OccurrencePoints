 1_get_taxonomic_info.R
################################################################################

 OVERVIEW: Takes a list of taxa and uses the taxize package to pull taxonomic
           information from multiple databases. The output can then be used to
           create a final list of target taxa and synonyms by hand. Data
           pulled includes:
             - Acceptance and authors from Tropicos, Integrated Taxonomic
                Information Service (ITIS), and The Plant List (TPL)
             - Authors from International Plant Names Index (IPNI) and
                Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS)
             - Synonyms from Tropicos and ITIS
 INPUTS: List of target taxa
 OUTPUTS: List of target taxa with acceptance, authors, and synonyms

# 2_get_raw_occurrence_points.R
################################################################################

# OVERVIEW: Provides manual instructions and code chunks for downloading and
#           standardizing wild occurrence points from:
#           * Global databases (though all likely have U.S. bias?):
#             - Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)
#             - Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio)
#             - U.S. Herbarium Consortia (SERNEC, SEINet, etc.)
#             - Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN)
#           * National databases:
#             - Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program, USDA Forest Service
# INPUTS: - List of target taxa, including synonyms and their accepted names
#             (target_taxa_with_syn.csv)
#         - FIA codes and species names (FIA_AppendixF_TreeSpeciesCodes_2016.csv)
#         - county and state codes (US_state_county_FIPS_codes.csv)
# OUTPUTS: Raw occurrence records for target taxa or genera (depending on how
#          the databaseâ€™s download works), one CSV for each database
